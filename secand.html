                The first thing you’ll need to learn is HTML, which is the structure of your website. HTML is what creates the elements you see on a page, like headings, paragraphs, and images. Then, we move on to CSS, which is used to make the website look nice. CSS controls the colors, fonts, and layout. Finally, we have JavaScript, which makes your website interactive. You can use JavaScript to add things like buttons, forms, and even animations.
